This was my Tumblr May 2014 Hackday project. It's an Android application that allows a user to look at Tumblr posts associated with Foursquare venues.

##Building
To get this application working correctly, you must sign up for API keys from both [Tumblr](https://www.tumblr.com/oauth/apps) and [Foursquare](https://foursquare.com/developers/apps). Once this has been completed, enter the client ID and secret for each service in `gradle.properties`.
